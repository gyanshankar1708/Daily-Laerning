Selectors in JS


document.getElementsByClassName("<ClassName>") -> This function selects all the element whose class name is given as parameter and returns as element node.
                

document.getElementById("<IdName>") -> This function selects the element whose id name is given as parameter.


document.querySelector("<parameter>">) ->  In query Selector we have to give parameter same as CSS like for class name we have to input .className and for id #IdName etc. In case of Class Name querySelector only select 1st element whose class name is given in parameter.

If we want to use querySelector on all element whose class name is box we have to use querySelectorAll.
But querySelectorAll returns HTML collections and we can not any style function directly on HTML collections so we have to use for each loop for performing out task.

Not only for each loop we can use any loop instead of for each.

we also have many similar type of selectors like getElementByTagName(), getElementByName() 

Matches, closest, Contains

<elementName>.matches("<CSS Selector>")  -> returns true if element matches the given CSS Selector.
<elementname>.closest("CSS Selector") -> returns the closest parent which matches the given CSS selector.
<elementName>.contains("<ElementName>") -> returns true if element name of parameter contains in the given element. like #red is in .container so if we check it returns true.
