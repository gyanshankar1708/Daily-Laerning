Events in JavaScript

A specific tast will occur on a specific event. Basically a function will be called as per specific event. that the library function used for assigning the event is eventListner

let btn = getElementByInd("btn");
btn.addEventListner("click",()=>{
    alert("You had clicked");
});

In this exeample if you click on the element whose id is btn then alert will occur.

There are many types of eventListner like click,dblclick, mouseover, mouseleave, etc 

Not ont mouse eventListner is also for keyboard events.



Event Bubbling :-

If 3 div are made with respective class name container>ChildContainer>ChildContainer
so if i click on child then the eventListner of child will trigger but also the eventListner on their parents will be trigger and the order will be child>ChildContainer>container

If you dont want bubbling then you have to take event as parameter in the function and then have to stopPropagation() in that eventListner function

setInterval(fn,interval) -> If i want to run any function in fixed interval of time then i have to run setInterval function and have to put interval in millisecond.

setTimeout(fn,timeout) -> If i want to run any particular function after cetrtain period of time and once. then i have to use setTimeout function and i have to put timeout in millisecond.

If i want to cancel timeout and interval we have to run clearTimeout() and clearInterval() and have to put the returning number value.
