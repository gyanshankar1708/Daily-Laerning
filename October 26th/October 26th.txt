DOM in JavaScript

Child, parent and Node


childNodeode - Child node is the child tag of any tag.
            Empty Space between any tag is also considerd as child node as #text.
    firstChild - firstChild returns the 1st child node of any node
    lastChild - lastChild returns the last child node of any node.

    Whenever we are using childnode we are getting #text which is not used by us. so we want to not to show that node so we use firstElementChild instead of firstChild and same lastElementChild instead of lastChild.


 parentNode  - It returns the parent node of that node

 children - Returns all the list of element childnodes of any element

 nextElementSibling - Returns the immediate next element sibling of that element
 previousElementSibling = Returns the immediate previous element sibling of that element

 Sibling also contains text node and coment node etc so if we use nextSibling or previousSibling we may get #text as result.
