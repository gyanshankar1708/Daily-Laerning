Today I learnt about Binary search in Matrix and solved 2 problem Search in 2D array and search in 2d aray II 

In 1st question we just have to hypothetically convert 2d array in 1 D array and implement Binary search in it.
for calculating row forrmula is row = mid/M; and for calculating col formula is col = mid%M;
where mid is the mid index where we have to check and M is the number of column.
Time complexity = O(M Log N)

In 2nd question we have to stand at (0,M-1) co-ordinate and then we have to check if we can decrease the col or increase the row to get the element.
Time complexity = O(M+N)
